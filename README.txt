🕵️ Scavenger Hunt Discord Bot
This is a Discord bot built with discord.py that features a $scavenger command. When triggered, the bot prompts the user to upload an image within 60 seconds, which it then saves locally to a ./downloads folder. The image is subsequently processed by an external AI function (scavenger_hunt) to determine the result of the hunt.
